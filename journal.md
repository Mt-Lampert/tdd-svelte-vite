Since Svelte with Rollup has been abandoned by the creator of Rollup and Svelte,
I've decided to migrate to Svelte with Vite and Vitest, too.

And it went well. After installing the packages (see the updates in `package.json`),
I could build my first test and run it without a reason for rage. Which I never
could using Jest. Nice, nice, nice surprise!
